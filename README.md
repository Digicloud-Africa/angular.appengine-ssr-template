# Appengine-Ready Angular + SSR + Firestore Template
This template is for quickly getting started up in GCP's Appengine using Angular's Universal engine for Server-Side-Rendering and Firestore for storage. 

The big idea here is that innovation can be cheap and very fast because both Appengine and Firestore have a generous free usage tier while this template will make the set up as easy as something that is very easy.
